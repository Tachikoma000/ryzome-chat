ABOUT RYZOME:
Ryzome is a visual workspace where your thoughts become connected insights. It's designed to solve the fundamental limitations of linear AI interactions by providing a 2D canvas where ideas exist as interconnected nodes.

KEY RYZOME FEATURES:

1. VISUAL CANVAS INTERFACE:
- Infinite 2D canvas for organizing thoughts
- Nodes that can contain text, images, PDFs, YouTube videos, and web pages
- Visual connections between nodes that build context
- Spatial thinking that mirrors how the mind works

2. AI-POWERED NODES:
- Every node is AI-enabled for content generation
- Connected nodes provide context to AI responses
- Context-aware AI that understands relationships between ideas
- Streaming responses with real-time generation

3. CONTENT TYPES SUPPORTED:
- Text nodes with full markdown support
- Image nodes (PNG, JPG, WebP) with drag-and-drop
- PDF documents (under 7MB recommended)
- YouTube videos (public videos only)
- Web pages (publicly accessible content)
- Copy-paste content from anywhere

4. CORE CAPABILITIES:
- Node creation by clicking anywhere on canvas
- Connecting nodes to build context chains
- AI generation using the "prompt hat" (ðŸŽ©) feature
- Cross-canvas node copying and sharing
- Real-time collaboration (coming soon)
- Canvas publishing and sharing

5. GETTING STARTED:
- Sign up at ryzome.ai (no API keys required)
- Create a canvas and add your first node
- Use markdown for rich text formatting
- Connect nodes to build context
- Use the prompt hat to generate AI responses

6. KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
- Click anywhere: Create new node
- Double-click: Edit node
- Space + Drag: Pan canvas
- Ctrl/Cmd + V: Paste content
- Delete: Remove selected nodes
- Ctrl/Cmd + Z: Undo
- Ctrl/Cmd + S: Save (auto-saves enabled)

7. BEST PRACTICES:
- Keep nodes focused on single topics
- Use connections to build meaningful context
- Leverage markdown for structure and formatting
- Connect multiple sources for comprehensive analysis
- Use clear, descriptive prompts for AI generation

8. COMMON USE CASES:
- Research synthesis and literature reviews
- Content creation and writing workflows
- Project planning and strategy mapping
- Knowledge management and note-taking
- Educational content organization
- Brainstorming and ideation sessions

9. LIMITATIONS TO BE AWARE OF:
- PDF files should be under 7MB for optimal performance
- Only public YouTube videos can be embedded
- Very large canvases (1000+ nodes) may impact performance
- Currently optimized for desktop use (mobile coming soon)

10. PRICING:
- Currently in public beta and free to use
- Credit-based system for AI generation
- Future plans will include free and paid tiers
