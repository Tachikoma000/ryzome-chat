What if your second brain could actually think with you? I'm Tachi, and this is Rhizome, where knowledge exploration comes alive with AI. If you're like me, you've got your notes scattered everywhere, whether you're using apps like Obsidian or Notion for your note-taking on knowledge management, or you're using apps like ChatGPT or Claude for AI-assisted research and brainstorming.

And then you realize you're constantly switching contexts, you're switching tabs, and now you're losing your flow, which is frustrating. But here's the real problem. You spend hours researching in ChatGP to your cloud and then suddenly realize a linear chat just doesn't work for how we actually think.

One thought branches into three, three branches into many, and you've now created multiple threads, which is now a nightmare of disconnected conversations with no way to see how they all reconnect or where the branches came from or how to connect the dots again. But what if there's a way to work that actually mirrors how our minds work, where thoughts branch naturally and connections stay visible and everything flows? This is why we've built Ryse.

Here's a real project I've been working on. It's a sustainable food delivery app. And in here, you can see I have images on competitors and innovators within the space connected to a report on how these innovators are performing in the market. I also have connections to general reports on the industry as a whole, some rules and guidelines and legislations and key challenges. And as you know this, as I'm conducting my research in

thinking of new topics or connected information, I'm able to chain these nodes together. What's really cool about this is each of these connected nodes are all AI powered, which means that the AI understands the full context of what I'm working on. And it's not just helping me organize my information, it's actually helping me synthesize it. Let me show you how easy this is. Here we have a blank node.

And within the node, can manually type my content. can say, hello world. But then I could also prompt the model or the AI model to generate content for me. I could say, write me a poem.

and I can run that.

What's really interesting here is that I'm able to use a node to manually write my notes, but also argument the content with the model. I can add multiple nodes to my canvas by clicking the add node button, connecting them together. And now I have a chain that I can essentially use to augment what I'm working on. I could probably say, are the themes.

spawn.

When I run that, it will connect to the connected node and then use that to generate new content. With this, you're able to essentially maintain your flow and keep branching off thoughts and ideas while seeing the connections and the branches and how everything fits back together. Going back to our original image, this is just what a few hours of focus work looks like with Rhizome. Nothing is scattered across multiple platforms or tools.

There's no lost chat threads. Everything is connected, visual, intelligent. My research has now become a living, breathing knowledge graph that thinks with me. Rhizome is where your thoughts connect, and I really can't wait to see what you build with it. Get started today at rhizome.ai.
