# What is Ryzome

**Description:**  Discover how Ryzome transforms visual thinking with AI-powered nodes and connections

Ryzome is a visual workspace where your thoughts become connected insights. It's designed to solve the fundamental limitations of linear AI interactions by providing a 2D canvas where ideas exist as interconnected nodes.

## The Problem with Linear AI Chat Interfaces

Traditional AI interfaces like ChatGPT and Claude force you into a linear conversation model. You constantly:

-   Switch contexts and lose your flow
-   Re-type prompts and explanations
-   Struggle to see connections between branching ideas
-   Hit the limits of what chat can handle for complex thinking

> **Key Insight:**  Linear chat fails for complex thought. Ryzome makes AI context-aware through visual relationships.

## The Ryzome Solution

Ryzome reimagines AI interaction through a spatial, visual interface. Instead of a chat thread, you work on an infinite canvas where:

### Visual & Spatial Interface

Every idea becomes a node on a 2D canvas. This mirrors how your mind actually works - thoughts branch naturally, connections stay visible, and everything flows.

### Connected Intelligence

When you connect nodes, the AI understands the full upstream context. It can synthesize information from multiple sources rather than just responding to isolated prompts.

### Agentic Core

Every node is AI-enabled. Generate content, transform ideas, synthesize insights - all while maintaining the visual context of your thinking process.

## Core Capabilities

Ryzome supports rich, multi-format content that adapts to what you need:

-   **Markdown-Enabled Nodes**: Full markdown support with images, tables, code blocks, and formatting
-   **Content Drop-In**: Import PDFs, YouTube videos, images, web pages, and text with automatic node creation
-   **Context Chains**: Connect nodes to build context that AI understands and can work with
-   **Instant Knowledge Graphs**: Watch your research evolve into living, interconnected insights

## How It's Different

> **Core Concept:**  Think "Obsidian Canvas meets AI, but reimagined" - Ryzome isn't just a tool for organizing thoughts, it's a collaborative thinking partner that understands the relationships between your ideas.

Unlike static note-taking apps or linear AI chats, Ryzome creates a  **second brain that actually thinks with you**. The spatial interface combined with context-aware AI enables new forms of knowledge work that weren't possible before.
