# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Ryzome?

Ryzome is a visual canvas for knowledge work where every note is AI-powered. Think Obsidian Canvas meets AI, reimagined for how we actually think.

## How does Ryzome work?

Create nodes for your ideas, connect them to build context, and use AI to expand, synthesize, or explore new directions. It's as simple as typing and connecting.

## How do I get started?

Just sign up and create a canvas. No setup required. Start with a single thought and watch it grow.

## What makes Ryzome different?

Unlike linear chat interfaces or static note apps, Ryzome lets you branch, connect, and visualize your thinking while AI understands the full context of your work.

## Do I need to provide my own API keys?

No! Ryzome provides AI access directly through a credit-based system. Just sign up and start creating - no complex setup required.

## Can I import my existing notes?

Yes! You can paste text, drag and drop files, or import content from URLs. Ryzome automatically creates the appropriate node type based on your content.

## How do connections work?

Draw connections between nodes to build context chains. When you use AI on a connected node, it understands the content from all directly connected nodes. Only direct connections count - no multi-hop chaining.

## Can I collaborate with others?

Collaboration features are in development. Currently, you can share your canvases publicly, and real-time collaboration is coming soon.

## Is my data secure?

Yes. Your canvases are private by default. We use industry-standard security practices and you control what gets shared publicly.

## What file formats does Ryzome support?

- **Text**: Markdown, plain text, rich text
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP
- **Documents**: PDF files
- **Media**: YouTube videos (via URL)
