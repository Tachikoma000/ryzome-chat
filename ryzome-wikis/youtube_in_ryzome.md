Ryzome recognizes various YouTube URL formats:

-   `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
-   `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
-   `https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`

## Video Node Features

YouTube nodes in Ryzome provide:

-   **Embedded player**  - Watch videos directly on your canvas
-   **Automatic metadata**  - Title, description, and thumbnail extraction
-   **Playback controls**  - Standard YouTube player functionality
-   **Responsive sizing**  - Resize video nodes to fit your canvas layout

## Using YouTube as AI Context

When you connect YouTube nodes to other nodes, the AI can:

-   **Analyze video content**  - Understand topics, themes, and key points
-   **Extract insights**  - Pull out main ideas and important information
-   **Generate summaries**  - Create concise overviews of video content
-   **Answer questions**  - Respond based on video material
-   **Create related content**  - Generate text that builds on video concepts

### Example Workflow

1.  Paste a YouTube URL for an educational video or presentation
2.  Connect the video node to a text node
3.  Use the prompt hat to ask: "Summarize the main points from this video"
4.  The AI will analyze the video content and provide key insights

> **💡 Educational Content Tip:**  YouTube nodes work especially well with tutorials, lectures, presentations, and educational content where the AI can extract structured information.

## Best Practices

-   **Educational content**: Works best with structured content like tutorials, podcasts, and presentations
-   **Clear audio**: Videos with clear speech provide better AI analysis
-   **Reasonable length**: Shorter videos (under 30 minutes) process faster
-   **Public videos**: Only public YouTube videos can be embedded

## Video Processing

> **ℹ️ Processing Information:**  YouTube video analysis depends on video length and content complexity. Shorter, more structured videos process faster.

When you first add a YouTube video:

1.  The video becomes immediately playable on your canvas
2.  Background processing extracts content for AI context
3.  Once processed, the video is used as context for AI generation

## YouTube + AI Workflows

Popular ways to use YouTube nodes with AI:

-   **Research synthesis**: Connect multiple related videos and generate comprehensive summaries
-   **Learning notes**: Create study guides and key takeaways from educational content
-   **Content inspiration**: Use videos as starting points for your own content creation
-   **Fact extraction**: Pull specific information and data points from video content
-   **Comparative analysis**: Connect multiple videos on similar topics for AI comparison

## Limitations

> **⚠️ Current Limitations:**
> 
> -   Only public YouTube videos can be embedded
> -   Processing time varies based on video length and content
> -   Very long videos (2+ hours) may have extended processing times
