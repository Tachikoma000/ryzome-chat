# Adding Images

**Description:**  Drag and drop images to create visual nodes

Images in Ryzome are powerful visual elements that can be used as standalone content or connected to other nodes for AI analysis and context.

**Video Guide Available:**  Adding Images - Drag and drop images to create visual nodes

## How to Add Images

### Method 1: Drag and Drop

Simply drag an image file from your computer directly onto the canvas. Ryzome will automatically create an image node at the drop location.

### Method 2: Paste from Clipboard

Copy an image from anywhere (web browser, screenshot, etc.) and paste it directly onto the canvas using:

-   `Cmd+V`  (Mac)
-   `Ctrl+V`  (Windows)

## Supported Formats

Ryzome supports all common image formats:

-   **PNG**  - Best for screenshots and graphics with transparency
-   **JPG/JPEG**  - Ideal for photos and complex images
-   **WebP**  - Modern format with excellent compression

## Using Images as AI Context

When you connect image nodes to other nodes, the AI can:

-   **Describe the image content**  in detail
-   **Extract text**  from images (OCR capabilities)
-   **Analyze visual elements**  like charts, diagrams, and infographics
-   **Reference image content**  when generating related text or insights

### Example Workflow

1.  Drop a screenshot of a chart or diagram onto your canvas
2.  Connect it to a text node
3.  Use the prompt hat to ask: "Analyze this chart and summarize the key insights"
4.  The AI will examine the image and provide detailed analysis

> **💡 Pro Tip:**  Images with text, charts, or diagrams work especially well as AI context. The AI can read and interpret visual information to enhance its responses.

## Best Practices

-   **High resolution**: Use clear, high-resolution images for better AI analysis
-   **Descriptive connections**: When connecting images, consider adding a brief text description of what you want the AI to focus on
-   **Organize visually**: Group related images near each other on the canvas
-   **File size**: Keep images under 10MB for optimal performance

## Image Node Features

-   **Zoom and pan**: Click on image nodes to view them in full detail
-   **Resize**: Drag the corners of image nodes to adjust their canvas size
-   **Move freely**: Drag image nodes anywhere on your canvas
-   **Connect easily**: Draw connections from any edge of the image node
