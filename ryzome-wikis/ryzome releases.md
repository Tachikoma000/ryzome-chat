What if your second brain could actually think with you? Today, we're proud to release Ryzome - where your knowledge comes alive with AI. So, what exactly is Ryzome? and how is it changing the way people think, create, and do work? Thread ![👇](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f447.svg "Down pointing backhand index")[1/12]

Picture this, you start researching a topic yesterday. By today, you've got 15 ChatGPT threads open. Each one a branch from another conversation. Now you're staring at several tabs full of insights that have become difficult to reconnect. This is how great ideas die. [2/12]

We've all been there. That moment when you KNOW you had the perfect insight about this exact thing yesterday. But which thread was it in? The one about market analysis? Or the one where you explored the technical angle? AI Chat wasn't built for how minds actually work. [3/12]

Truth is ChatGPT and Claude are incredible thinking tools trapped in the worst possible interface. Your mind branches naturally. You explore parallel ideas. You loop back to earlier thoughts. But chat forces everything into a single, suffocating line. [4/12]

The real cost? It's not just lost notes or insights. It's the compound effect of broken momentum. Starting over every session. Recreating context every time. That brilliant connection between concept A and insight B? Gone. Because chat threads can't hold the architecture of complex thought. [5/12]

We knew we had to build something different. Not another app to add to the pile. Not ChatGPT with a different coat of paint. We built Ryzome - where your knowledge actually grows the way your mind works. [6/12]

Imagine opening a canvas and seeing your entire research journey laid out visually. Every insight in its place. Every connection preserved. Every branch of thought ready to explore further. And the AI? It understands the whole map, not just the last message. [7/12]

In Ryzome, every single node can think. Type your research about market trends. Ask the AI to expand it. Now connect it to your competitor analysis node. The AI sees both, and understands the relationship. Your notes aren't just storage. They're active intelligence. [8/12]

Now, AI augmented research that generally spans multiple tabs, threads and apps, are self contained in a visual-spacial environment much closer to how our brains work. For example, consider this chain of thought and research for a product developer: Customer research → Product insights → Technical constraints → Final solution All in one canvas. The AI doesn't just see the last node. It understands the entire journey. Ryzome enables context that actually accumulates. [9/12]

And because thinking shouldn't have friction, we've made Ryzome really easy to get started and use. All nodes allow you to write naturally with full markdown support! Also, no need for API keys or complex configurations. Simply login and start creating in literally seconds [10/12]

What's emerged from early users amazes us daily: "It's like ChatGPT with a photographic memory" , "I can finally see how my ideas connect", "This is how AI should work"... Researchers mapping complex topics in hours, not weeks. Writers keeping every narrative thread alive. Founders connecting insights to decisions visually. This is what happens when tools finally match how we think. [11/12]

I love Ryzome and think you'll love it too! I can't wait to see what you create with this tool. Get started with Ryzome today: [https://ryzome.ai](https://t.co/dTyv6860BY) [12/12]

I'm really excited to share the latest feature in Ryzome: YouTube drop-in. Picture this. It's 2 a.m., physics exam tomorrow. You're knee-deep in YouTube, bouncing between Professor Leonard and Khan Academy, maybe throwing in some random guy who explains electrodynamics better than anyone on the planet. We've all been there. 1/3

From high school, university, and beyond, we all have learned a lot from Youtube. Lectures at 2x speed, coding tutorials, podcasts, and those 3-hour philosophy talks you swear you'll finish (you never do). But trying to actually USE what you learned? Screenshots of whiteboards, timestamps scattered in notes, multiple tabs open. The whole process is tedious. The gap between finding that perfect explanation and getting it into your actual work is huge. 2/3

So we built YouTube drop-in into Ryzome. Just paste any YouTube URL into your canvas. The AI watches alongside you, extracts key concepts, creates study guides, whatever you need. Have multiple videos to watch? Simply connect them, and Ryzome finds patterns across all of them. Ryzome enables streamlined, efficient, and intuitive connected knowledge. Try it yourself at [http://ryzome.ai](https://t.co/zNBFYQnbtM) 3/3 - End of thread

another upcoming ryzome feature: copy and paste text or images from anywhere directly into your canvas, minimizing friction while greatly increasing your workflow. [https://ryzome.ai](https://t.co/dTyv6860BY)

trillions of dollars spent on AI and the only interface is still a chatbot. still no branching canvas, no mindmap, no dimensionality, no forking, no inversion, no merging. no custom functions. no style and no creativity

this frustration drove us to build ryzome. visual canvas where every thought can branch, merge, and evolve with ai that understands the connections. using chatbots for complex thinking is like writing a novel in text messages. not how the mind works [https://ryzome.ai](https://t.co/b4NFVbXQoN)

major updates to ryzome are live! what’s new: - cross‑canvas intelligence - real‑time ai reasoning and streaming - node labeling - instant regeneration ryzome is now more intuitive and faster watch this quick demo on the newest features! more details in thread below![🧵](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f9f5.svg "Thread") 1/6

first up, cross‑canvas intelligence knowledge compounds when it’s portable. in ryzome, you can now copy nodes between canvases, keep context, and let research flow across projects 2/6

next up, real‑time reasoning + streaming in the newest updates, you can now see the ai reason through your prompt and stream its responses as they form in real time we believe this feature will keep you in flow and improve the immersive experience of your canvas 3/6

by popular demand, we're introducing node labeling. you can now name any node on your canvas for better organization and to reference nodes across canvases. simply tag a node title in your prompt to reference it. 4/6

there's still a ton of exciting features on the way! coming soon: - drag and drop images and pdf files for processing - drop any youtube url for transcript extraction - connect to external services like github ... and much more! 5/6

we’re building ryzome to match how you naturally think and work. less software, more flow. try it free today: [https://ryzome.ai](https://t.co/dTyv686yrw) end of thread 6/6

AI chats currently disappear into a black hole of chat history. Ryzome Canvas fixes this as a visual AI workspace where every response becomes a building block you can actually see, connect, and reuse. Start with scattered notes → Build living workflows How it works: • Drop anything in: messy thoughts, drafts, images, data • Add AI prompts to transform any content • Connect nodes like LEGO: output from one becomes input for another • See your entire thinking process mapped out visually All visible. All connected. All reusable. Stop losing brilliant AI outputs in endless chat threads. Start building knowledge that compounds.
