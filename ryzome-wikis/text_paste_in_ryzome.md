## How to Add Text Content

### Method 1: Direct Paste

Copy text from anywhere (web pages, documents, emails, etc.) and paste it directly onto the canvas using:

-   `Cmd+V`  (Mac)
-   `Ctrl+V`  (Windows)

### Method 2: Smart Formatting

Ryzome automatically detects and preserves:

-   **HTML formatting**  from web pages
-   **Rich text**  from documents
-   **Code blocks**  with syntax highlighting
-   **Tables**  and structured data
-   **Links**  and references

### Method 3: Manual Entry

Click anywhere on the canvas to create a new node and start typing directly.

## What Happens When You Paste

Ryzome intelligently processes pasted content:

-   **HTML to Markdown**: Web content is converted to clean markdown
-   **Formatting preservation**: Bold, italic, headers, and lists are maintained
-   **Link extraction**: URLs become clickable links
-   **Structure detection**: Tables and code blocks are properly formatted
-   **Clean output**: Unnecessary styling and clutter are removed

## Text Node Features

Text nodes in Ryzome offer:

-   **Live markdown rendering**  - See formatted output as you type
-   **Syntax highlighting**  - Code blocks are automatically highlighted
-   **Auto-linking**  - URLs become clickable links
-   **Rich formatting**  - Full markdown support including tables and lists
-   **Expandable content**  - Nodes grow to accommodate your content

## Using Text as AI Context

Text nodes are fundamental building blocks for AI workflows. When connected to other nodes, they provide:

-   **Rich context**  - Detailed information for AI to reference
-   **Structured input**  - Headers and formatting help AI understand content hierarchy
-   **Source material**  - Base content for AI to expand, summarize, or transform
-   **Reference points**  - Specific facts and data for AI to build upon

### Example Workflow

1.  Paste an article or research excerpt into a node
2.  Create a new node and connect it to the text node
3.  Use the prompt hat to ask: "What are the key insights from this content?"
4.  The AI will analyze the text and generate focused insights

> **💡 Research Workflow Tip:**  Paste multiple related articles or excerpts into separate nodes, then connect them all to an analysis node for comprehensive synthesis.

## Best Practices

-   **Clean source material**: Well-formatted source text produces better results
-   **Logical structure**: Use headers and lists to organize information
-   **Focused content**: Keep each node focused on a specific topic or idea
-   **Meaningful connections**: Connect related text nodes to build comprehensive context
-   **Edit after pasting**: Clean up any formatting issues after pasting

## Common Text Sources

Text nodes work great with content from:

-   **Web articles**  - News, blog posts, research articles
-   **Documents**  - Word docs, Google Docs, PDFs (copy/paste)
-   **Emails**  - Important correspondence and information
-   **Notes**  - Meeting notes, research notes, personal thoughts
-   **Code**  - Programming code with syntax highlighting
-   **Data**  - CSV, JSON, and structured information

## Formatting Tips

> **ℹ️ Markdown Reference:**  Use the Writing in a Node guide for complete markdown formatting reference.

-   Use  `**bold**`  and  `*italic*`  for emphasis
-   Create headers with  `#`,  `##`,  `###`
-   Make lists with  `-`  or  `1.`
-   Add code with backticks:  `code`
-   Create tables with  `|`  separators
-   Add links with  `[text](url)`  format
