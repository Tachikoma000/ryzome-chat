# Quick Start

**Description:**  Get productive with Ryzome in minutes

Get up and running with Ryzome in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through creating your first canvas and experiencing the power of connected thinking.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Sign Up

Create your Ryzome account at  [ryzome.ai](https://ryzome.ai/). No API keys or complex setup required - just sign up and you're ready to start thinking visually.

### Step 2: Dashboard Overview

Once logged in, you'll see your dashboard with options to create a new canvas. Click "Create canvas" to start your first visual workspace.

**Video Guide Available:**  Dashboard walkthrough showing canvas creation buttons and interface overview

### Step 3: Add a Node

Click anywhere on the canvas to create your first node. Ryzome nodes support rich markdown content including:

-   **Images and media**  - Drag and drop or paste directly
-   **URLs and links**  - Automatically formatted and previewed
-   **Tables and data**  - CSV, JSON, and structured content
-   **Code blocks**  - Syntax highlighted code snippets
-   **Rich formatting**  - Headers, lists, emphasis, and more

**Video Guide Available:**  Creating a node and adding different types of content (text, image, table, code)

### Step 4: Use AI (Prompt Hat)

Click the "prompt hat" icon (🎩) on any node to activate AI generation. Here's how it works:

-   **Overwrites existing content**: The AI replaces the current node content with its response
-   **Node is both input and response**: Your prompt becomes the AI's answer
-   **Directly editable**: You can edit the AI-generated content immediately
-   **Context-aware**: Connected nodes provide context for better responses

> **⚠️ Important Warning:**  The prompt hat overwrites your node content. If you want to keep the original, duplicate the node first.

**Video Guide Available:**  Using the prompt hat to generate content

### Step 5: Build Context with Connections

Connect nodes by dragging from one node's edge to another. This is where Ryzome's power shines:

-   **Direct connections only**: Only directly connected nodes count as context
-   **Multiple inputs allowed**: A node can receive context from several connected nodes

**Video Guide Available:**  Creating connections between nodes and demonstrating how context flows to AI generation
